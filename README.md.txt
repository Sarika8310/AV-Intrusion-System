# ðŸš— Smart Car Intrusion Detection System

A machine learning-powered Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to identify cyber-attacks on autonomous vehicle CAN bus networks in real time.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Autonomous vehicles rely on CAN (Controller Area Network) communication between electronic components. This project detects abnormal behavior (DoS attacks) using machine learning and displays results via a Streamlit web app.

## ðŸ“‚ Features

- CAN Bus data pre-processing and hex decoding
- Random Forest model for real-time attack detection
- Streamlit interface to upload and analyze CAN data
- Detection logs with confidence scores
- Downloadable results as CSV

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning

- **Model**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Accuracy**: ~99% on test data
- **Features**: ID, D1â€“D8 (decoded hex), Len
- **Classes**: 
  - `0`: Normal
  - `1`: DoS Attack
